Just stepped out from 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Kimge kereksin, and wow, my brain feels like a tangled mess of emotions — somewhere between Was that genius? and Did I just waste two hours of my life? My fellow  -goers were scratching their heads too, so at least I'm not alone in this whirlpool of confusion and tenuous awe.

Okay, first off, I’m not sure who gave the green light for that soundtrack, but man, those violins were wailing like an old cat locked out in the rain. And the plot was this maze of existential dread? It’s like they took a YA novel and decided to deep-fry it in philosophical angst. Don’t get me wrong, I love a good think piece... but by halfway through I was ready to steal the remote and fast-forward to some clarity, and I'm a flight attendant — we're all about the journey more than the destination.

Now, about those characters. There's this one scene where the main dude has a meltdown in a bakery (because buttered croissants apparently hold the secrets of the universe?), and I couldn't help but snicker. Maybe I've just seen too many passengers freak out over peanuts on delayed flights to take it seriously. But by some miracle, or maybe a Stockholm syndrome of cinema, I was actually rooting for him by the end. Who knew?

> Here’s where I thought to myself, how did they even cast these folks? Somehow, each actor looked vaguely like someone you’d see sipping burnt coffee in the airport lounge at 3 AM.

Oh, and the visuals! Somewhere between a dusty postcard from my grandma and those dreams you have when you've slept way too long on a turbulent plane. I mean, who shoots a whole scene in weird muted pastels? It’s like they ran Instagram filters over the whole thing until it felt surreal enough to hurt. My inner critic was screaming, but at the same time, it felt like being wrapped in a fog of nostalgia nobody asked for.

And speaking of foggy nostalgia — can we talk about that ending? It's like someone threw the script in a blender and forgot to put the lid on. Loose threads everywhere. I'm gonna have to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again just to make sure I didn’t hallucinate half of it. Or maybe I won't because torture doesn't really equal entertainment in my book.

Here's a random snippet of JavaScript for no apparent reason — maybe it'll help decode that confounding chat between the protagonists: 
```javascript
function meaningOfLife() {
  return 42;
}
```
Might as well try anything at this point.

So anyway, if you fancy your brain cells getting tangled in a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 that’s equal parts baffling and brilliant — Kimge kereksin is your ride. Or maybe skip it and read a book in the departure lounge instead. Both seem equally enlightening tonight.
